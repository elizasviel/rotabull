  "suggested_response_A": "Thank you for reaching out, Brandon. I understand your concerns about pricing and appreciate you sharing your feedback with us. Let me address your points and provide some clarification:\n\n1. Our pricing structure is based on a flat monthly fee that includes unlimited quotes, not a per-quote charge. Your current plan, Cruise, is $499 per month.\n\n2. Based on the receipt you shared, you sent 444 quotes last month. This means your actual cost per quote was about $1.12, which decreases as you send more quotes.\n\n3. We offer a comprehensive platform that includes features beyond just quoting, such as inventory management, marketplace integrations, and customer relationship management tools.\n\n4. Regarding email usage, Rotabull allows you to use your own company email domain. We offer whitelabeling options that let you send emails from your Sentinel Aerospace email address.\n\nGiven your concerns, I'd like to propose a few options:\n\n1. We could review your current usage and explore ways to optimize your workflow to get more value from the platform.\n\n2. We can look into whether a different pricing tier might be more suitable for your needs. Our pricing is tiered based on quote volume, so if your volume increases, you may be eligible for a more cost-effective plan.\n\n3. I can escalate your pricing concern to our management team for review.\n\nWe value your business and want to ensure Rotabull continues to be a cost-effective solution for Sentinel Aerospace. Would you be open to scheduling a call to discuss these options and see how we can best address your needs? \n\nAlso, I'd like to understand more about the auto-quoting competitor you mentioned. While their per-quote price might seem lower, it's important to consider the full range of features and support you're getting with Rotabull. However, we're always looking to improve our offering and remain competitive in the market.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. We're committed to finding a solution that works for you.",
  "suggested_response_B": "Dear Brandon,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding your concerns about pricing. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention and would like to clarify some points about our pricing structure and value proposition.\n\nFirst, I want to emphasize that Rotabull uses a flat fee pricing model, not a per-quote basis. According to your recent invoice, you were charged a flat fee of $499 for the period of July 1 - July 31, 2024, during which you sent 444 quotes. This actually works out to about $1.12 per quote, which is lower than your initial estimate.\n\nHere are some key points about our pricing structure:\n\n1. Tiered pricing: Our pricing is tiered based on quote volume. As your volume increases, the effective price per quote decreases. We'd be happy to review your usage to see if there's a more suitable plan for your needs.\n\n2. Inclusive features: The flat fee includes access to all of Rotabull's features, including marketplace integrations, CRM functionality, and robust quoting tools. This comprehensive approach often provides better overall value compared to per-quote pricing models.\n\n3. No hidden costs: Unlike some competitors, we don't charge extra for additional users or basic features. You can add as many team members as needed at no extra cost.\n\n4. Email flexibility: Rotabull is designed to work with your existing email. There's no requirement to change your email address to use our service.\n\n5. Custom solutions: For high-volume users, we offer custom pricing solutions. Given your quote volume, we may be able to provide a more tailored plan that better fits your needs.\n\nI understand that cost-effectiveness is crucial for your business. To address this, I'd like to schedule a call to discuss:\n\n- Your specific usage patterns and needs\n- Potential volume discounts based on your quote numbers\n- Any features you're not currently utilizing that could add more value to your subscription\n- Comparison of our full-feature offering to the basic auto-quoting solutions you're considering\n\nPlease let me know a convenient time for this call. We value your business and are committed to finding a solution that provides the best value for Sentinel Aerospace.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nRotabull Customer Support"

  "suggested_response_A": "Thank you for bringing these listing sync alerts to our attention. I understand the urgency of the situation, given the 48-hour escalation window. I'll address each of the active alerts you've reported:\n\n1. Chromalloy Material Solutions (ILS)\n2. Focused Air Sales (ePlane and ILS)\n3. aviationscouts GmbH (ILS)\n4. Wibdi Aviation Company (ILS and PartsBase)\n5. AeroVision International (ILS and PartsBase)\n6. Intersky Precision Aerospace (AeroXchange, ILS, PartsBase, and The145)\n7. Newcastle Aviation (AeroXchange, ILS, Locatory, PartsBase, StockMarket, and The145)\n8. Aircrafters (ILS)\n\nOur team will take immediate action to address these sync issues:\n\n1. We'll investigate each alert to determine the root cause of the sync problem.\n2. For syncs that can be quickly resolved, we'll make the necessary adjustments to reactivate them.\n3. If any syncs require more complex solutions or input from the organizations, we'll reach out to them directly to gather information and work on a resolution.\n4. In cases where syncs need to be deactivated for compliance or other reasons, we'll take care of that promptly.\n\nGiven the recurring nature of some of these alerts (particularly for Wibdi Aviation Company), we'll pay special attention to identifying any underlying issues that may be causing persistent problems.\n\nWe'll prioritize these tasks to address as many issues as possible within the 48-hour window. Our goal is to have all syncs either fixed or deactivated before the escalation occurs.\n\nI'll provide you with an update on our progress within the next 24 hours. If you have any additional information about these syncs or specific concerns about particular organizations or marketplaces, please let me know, as it could help us in prioritizing and addressing the issues more effectively.\n\nRest assured, we're committed to resolving these sync alerts and maintaining the smooth operation of our listing integrations. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues.",
  "suggested_response_B": "Thank you for bringing these active listing sync alerts to our attention. I appreciate you notifying us about this issue. I'll summarize the current situation and outline our next steps:\n\nCurrent Status:\nWe have multiple organizations with active alerts for listing syncs across various marketplaces. These alerts have been active for different periods, some dating back to July 2023.\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Our technical team will investigate each of these sync issues individually to determine the root cause.\n2. We'll work on fixing the syncs that can be resolved and deactivate those that cannot be immediately fixed.\n3. We'll prioritize the older alerts, starting with Wibdi Aviation Company's ILS and PartsBase syncs.\n\nImportant Notes:\n- For ILS syncs: Listings are processed during ILS business hours (US Central time zone) Monday - Friday. Once Rotabull sends the inventory, it can take up to 24 hours before appearing live on www.ilsmart.com. We'll check if expediting is needed through your ILS representative.\n- For PartsBase: If there are any format mismatches between your inventory file and PartsBase's expected format, it can cause errors. We'll verify the file format to ensure smooth syncing.\n- For Aeroxchange: Syncing is not instantaneous and can take up to 48 hours to appear live on aeroxchange.com. We'll confirm if this is causing any of the alerts.\n\nTimeline:\nWe understand the urgency of this matter and will begin addressing these issues immediately. Our team will work diligently to resolve or deactivate these syncs within the next 48 hours to prevent ticket escalation.\n\nUpdate:\nWe'll provide you with a status update within 24 hours, detailing our progress and any actions taken. This update will include:\n- Confirmation of syncs that have been fixed or deactivated\n- Any issues requiring further investigation or action from marketplace representatives\n- Recommendations for optimizing your listing rules to ensure the right inventory is being sent daily\n\nIf you have any additional information or concerns regarding these sync issues, please don't hesitate to let us know. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve these alerts."

I'd be happy to help you set this up and explain how we can avoid duplicating RFQs from integrated sources like ILS and PartsBase.\n\nHere's what we can do:\n\n1. Set up email forwarding from your RFQ@AMP-AERO.COM inbox to your unique Rotabull inbound email address (found under Settings > Email Settings in your Rotabull account, typically in the format my_company@app.partsrfq.com).\n\n2. Rotabull will automatically process incoming RFQs from this forwarded email, while still receiving RFQs from other integrated platforms.\n\nImportant note: Our system is designed to reject emails that are forwarded directly if they come from marketplaces like ILS or PartsBase. This prevents duplication of RFQs that are already being automatically captured through our integrations.\n\nFor any non-marketplace RFQs sent to your RFQ@AMP-AERO.COM address, these will be successfully forwarded and processed by Rotabull.\n\nTo monitor the status of directly emailed RFQs, you can use the \"Direct RFQ Emails\" button in the bottom left of the Deals section in Rotabull. This shows the processing status of emails received in the last 30 days.\n\nI'd be happy to schedule a call to walk you through this setup process and answer any additional questions you may have.

You can find this address in your Rotabull account under Settings > Email Settings. Once set up, you'll need to forward your RFQ@AMP-AERO.COM emails to this Rotabull address.\n\nFor your existing integrations:\n\n1. ILS: You can change your ILS settings to send RFQs directly to your Rotabull email address.\n2. PartsBase: We'll need to provision API access for your account. Once you confirm you'd like to proceed, we'll initiate this process with PartsBase on your behalf.\n\nTo ensure everything is working correctly, we recommend testing the system by forwarding a sample RFQ to your Rotabull email address once it's set up.\n\nTo schedule a call and discuss this in more detail, could you please provide some convenient times for you in the next few days?

  "suggested_response_B": "Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention regarding the sync status discrepancy between our dashboard and PartsBase's website. I apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing.\n\nBased on the information in our support articles, I can provide some additional insights:\n\n1. PartsBase updates typically take a few minutes to process. However, if PartsBase detects any changes to the upload file format, the upload goes into a \"manual queue.\" In this case, it can take a few hours or up to a day or two for the changes to be shown live on their site. This may explain why you're seeing updates on PartsBase but not on our dashboard.\n\n2. There's a possibility that the file format we're using for your inventory doesn't match PartsBase's expected format. This mismatch can cause errors that prevent your inventory from being displayed correctly on PartsBase.\n\nTo address this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Please check if the inventory file format we're using matches the PartsBase default format. You can find an example of the correct format in our support documentation.\n\n2. If you notice any discrepancies in the file format, please let us know immediately so we can adjust it.\n\n3. If the format seems correct, we may need to contact PartsBase customer support to expedite the approval of any updates that might be stuck in their manual queue.\n\nIn the meantime, could you please provide:\n1. The exact date and time when you last noticed this discrepancy\n2. Any error messages you may have encountered\n3. Screenshots of both our dashboard and the PartsBase website showing the difference in sync status (if possible)\n\nThis information will help our technical team investigate and resolve the issue more efficiently.\n\nWe appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at support@rotabull.com."

How long has this increased traffic been occurring?\n2. Are there specific times of day when you notice higher traffic or is it consistent throughout?\n3. Have you noticed any correlation between Rotabull usage and the increase in traffic?\n\nWhile we investigate, I'd like to provide some information about Rotabull's data management:\n\n1. For inventory updates, we recommend uploading new inventory as frequently as possible, ideally daily. This helps synchronize your RFQs from online marketplaces efficiently.\n\n2. If you're using our FTP inventory uploads feature, we typically enable daily uploads automatically. This ensures your inventory is always up-to-date across all connected marketplaces.\n\n3. Regarding ERP integration, Rotabull is designed to have minimal impact on your system. Most of our functionality involves reading data, with only small amounts of new data being inserted when necessary. We never delete data from your ERP's database.\n\n4. If you're using any of our marketplace integrations (like PartsBase or ePlane), there might be additional data transfers occurring to keep your listings synchronized.\n\nWe'll be examining our systems to see if there are any unusual patterns or increased data transfers on our end that could be contributing to the increased server traffic.\n\nIf you have any questions or additional information, please don't hesitate to share. We're committed to resolving this issue and ensuring Rotabull operates efficiently without impacting your other systems.\n\nThank you for your patience as we work on this. We'll keep you updated on our findings.\n\nBest regards,\nRotabull Support Team"
